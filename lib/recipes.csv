Garlic Butter,"This easy garlic butter recipe proves that sometimes the basics are the best! Butter, garlic, a few herbs and spices, and a little Parmesan cheese are all you need to make this decadent garlic butter. I've used this simple recipe for years to make garlic bread, and any leftovers go great on barbequed steaks, pasta, rice, or potatoes.",4.5,10 mins,false
